# BlackJack-RL

This is my first RL agent using a Monte Carlo method. First we generate an episode. Then loop back through each step and
assign each state value pair the current value of the expected reward. Once an episode is completed the current policy is
updated to be greedy with respect to the current action values.

## Getting Started

Simply run the script to train the agent and generate a graph of the results.

``
python3 monte.py
``

### Prerequisites
numpy, matplotlib
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
